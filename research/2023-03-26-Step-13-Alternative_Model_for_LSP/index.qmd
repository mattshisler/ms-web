## Intro

Here we will develop the the full workflow for a spatial analysis of land-surface phenology using a vegetation index constructed from remotely-sensed surface reflectance and emmitance.

Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a spatial domain partitioned into a regular lattice of $n$ areal units which we will refer to as "locations" or "pixels". Index these units by $s \in S,\, S = \{1,2,\dots,n\}$. 

In year $t$, a satellite captures imagery from the earth's surface for a subset of days $\mathbf{d}_t \subset \{1, 2, \dots, m\}$ where $m$ may take on a value of 365 or 366, either choice does not appear to be consequential. 


Let $Y_{s,t,j} \in (0,1)$ be the vegetation index (VI) observed on day $d_{t,j}$ of year $t$ at pixel $s$. Though the VI is restricted to the interval $(0,1)$, we nevertheless adopt a Gaussian model with mean function $v(d;\boldsymbol\theta)$, parameterized by the $p \times 1$ vector $\boldsymbol\theta$, and variance $\sigma^2$ which represents the random noise in the satellite measurements. The assumption is that the true mean is bounded sufficiently far from the physical limits of $0$ and $1$ and the random noise is small so that there is practically no scenario in which we will be required to model values of $0$ or $1$. Notationally,

$$
Y_{s,t,j} \sim \text{Normal}\left(v(d_{t,j};\boldsymbol\theta_{s,t}), \sigma^2\right)
$$
where $v(d;\boldsymbol{\theta}) : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the so-called double logistic function, $v(d;\boldsymbol\theta) : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$,
$$
v(d, \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \theta_1 + (\theta_2 - \theta_7d)\left(\frac{1}{1 +\exp\left\{\frac{d - \theta_3}{\theta_5}\right\}} - \frac{1}{1 +\exp\left\{\frac{d - \theta_4}{\theta_6}\right\}}\right)
$$
The parameters of the double-logistic function are readily interpretable in a way that will be explained later.

At the first step in the analysis we aggregate the data over some pre-defined space and time domain whose "typical" or "average" phenological characteristics are to be estimated using a frequentist non-linear least squares regression. This amounts to estimating $\boldsymbol\theta$ for the aggregated data. Denote the estimate as $\widehat{\boldsymbol\theta}_{0}$. We then linearize the double-logistic function centered on $\widehat{\boldsymbol\theta}_{0}$,
$$
v(d;\boldsymbol\theta) \approx v(d; \widehat{\boldsymbol\theta}_0) + \nabla_{\boldsymbol\theta} v(d; \boldsymbol\theta)|_{\boldsymbol\theta = \widehat{\boldsymbol\theta}_0}(\boldsymbol\theta -\widehat{\boldsymbol\theta}_0)
$$

From this linearization we define the following,
$$
\begin{align*}
r_{s,t,j} &= Y_{s,t,j} - v(d_{t,j}, \widehat{\boldsymbol\theta}_0),\\
X_0(d) &=  \nabla_{\boldsymbol\theta} v(d; \boldsymbol\theta)|_{\boldsymbol\theta = \widehat{\boldsymbol\theta}_0},\\
\boldsymbol\delta_{s,t} &= \boldsymbol\theta_{s,t} - \widehat{\boldsymbol\theta}_0.
\end{align*}
$$
Here, $r_{s,t,j}$ are the residuals from the model of the domain's typical phenological characteristics, the gradient $X_0(d)$ is regarded as a set of basis functions, and $\boldsymbol\delta_{s,t}$ represents the deviation in phenological characteristics for pixel $s$ in year $t$ from the domain's typical characteristics, $\widehat{\boldsymbol\theta}_0$.

Next, we construct the $m \times p$ "parent" design matrix $\mathbf{X}_0$ with rows $X_0(d)$, $d = 1,2,\dots,m$. Then define the "child" design matrix $\mathbf{X}_{s,t}$ for each pixel-year pair $(s,t)$ by sub-setting the rows of $\mathbf{X}_0$ that correspond to the days $\mathbf{d}_t$ for which VI measurements were collected for $(s,t)$.

This facilitates modeling through the residuals,
$$
\mathbf{r}_{s,t} \sim \text{Normal}\left(\mathbf{X}_{s,t}\boldsymbol\delta_{s,t}, \sigma^2\mathbf{I}\right)
$$
where $\mathbf{r}_{s,t}$ is the vector of residuals at pixel-year pair $(s,t)$ and $\mathbf{I}$ is an identity matrix of sufficient dimension, unspecified because the number of VI measurements vary across pixel-year pairs.

We have transformed the task of modeling a non-linear mean function, $v(d;\boldsymbol\theta)$, to modeling a linear mean function $\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol\delta$. A key assumption is that any specific pixel-year pair does not deviate substantially from the domain's typical phenological characteristics. Otherwise the linearization will produce a poor approximation to the original non-linear mean function.

If the goal of the analysis is to identify climate trends across pixels in the spatial domain as a function of other climatological factors, then we may consider collapsing this model into a more computationally manageable scheme.

We can construct the usual estimates for $\boldsymbol\delta_{s,t}$ and their corresponding variance, $\text{Var}(\widehat{\boldsymbol\delta}_{s,t})$, from our model of the residuals. These are of course,
$$
\widehat{\boldsymbol\delta}_{s,t} = \left(\mathbf{X}^T_{s,t}\mathbf{X}_{s,t}\right)^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T_{s,t}\mathbf{r}_{s,t} \quad \text{and} \quad \text{Var}(\widehat{\boldsymbol\delta}_{s,t}) = \sigma^2\left(\mathbf{X}^T_{s,t}\mathbf{X}_{s,t}\right)^{-1} = \sigma^2\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}^{-1}_{s,t}
$$
leaving $\sigma^2$ to be estimated later.

As a parenthetical note, we could go so far as to consider $\sigma^2$ fixed by using the results of research on the measurement noise associated with collection apparatus.

Then we will consider a Bayesian hierarchical model incorporating climatological covariates, $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Z}}_{s,t}$ for year $t$ at pixel $s$, and the associated spatial effects $\boldsymbol\beta_s$ on which we place a multivariate conditionally autoregressive (MCAR) prior with common propriety parameter $\rho$. The model is,
$$
\begin{align*}
\widehat{\boldsymbol\delta}_{s,t} &\sim \text{Normal}(\mathcal{Z}_{s,t}\boldsymbol\beta_{s}, \sigma^2\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}^{-1}_{s,t})\\
\boldsymbol\beta_{s} &\sim \text{MCAR}(\rho, \boldsymbol\Lambda)\\
\sigma^2 &\sim \text{InvGamma}(a,b)\\
\boldsymbol\Lambda &\sim \text{InvWishart}(\nu, \mathbf{G})
\end{align*}
$$

The full conditionals for this model are:

Alternatively, we may consider replacing $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}_{s,t} = \mathbf{X}^T_{t,s}\mathbf{X}_{t,s}$ with $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}_0 = \mathbf{X}_0^T\mathbf{X}_0$ which will simplify the full conditionals accordingly:
