```{r, include=FALSE}
library(expm)
library(MASS)
```

### Step 1

Create a vector of transition probabilities from a single state.
```{r}
num.states <- 8

t1 <- runif(num.states)
t1 <- t1/sum(t1)

round(t1,3)
```

### Step 2

Create the entire transition matrix. Note this actually throws out the first vector we
created in step 1, but fulfills the overall spirit of the exercise.
```{r}
P <- matrix(runif(num.states^2), nrow = num.states)
P <- P/rowSums(P)
round(P,3)
```

### Step 3

Simulate the Markov chain with initial state $X_0 = 1$. Store the proportion of time the chain was in state $j$, $j=1,\dots,8$.
```{r}
current.state <- 1
num.steps <- 10000
visits1 <- rep(0, num.states)

for (i in 1:num.steps){

  visits1[current.state] <- visits1[current.state] + 1
  current.state <- sample(1:num.states, 1, prob = P[current.state,])
    
}

round(visits1/sum(visits1),3)

```

### Step 4

Simulate the Markov chain with initial states $X_0 = 2,\dots,8$. For each initial state, store the proportion of time the chain was in state $j$, $j=1,\dots,8$.

```{r}
visits2    <- matrix(0, nrow=num.states-1, ncol=num.states)
num.steps <- 10000

for (j in 1:(num.states-1)){
  current.state <- j
  
  for (i in 1:num.steps){

    visits2[j, current.state] <- visits2[j, current.state] + 1
    current.state <- sample(1:num.states, 1, prob = P[current.state,])
    
  }
  
}

round(visits2/rowSums(visits2),3)

```


### Step 5

Compare the proportion vectors from questions 3 and 4.

```{r}

boxplot(visits2/rowSums(visits2))
points(visits1/sum(visits1), col = "red", cex = 8, pch = ".")
```

Regardless of the initial state, the proportions are similar.

### Step 6

Compute the $P^{100}$ matrix multiplication. Are its rows approx equal? How do they compare the row vectors from step 5?

```{r}
round(P %^% 100,3)

```

The rows of $P^{100}$ are, for all intents and purposes, equal. They are similar to the values observed in question 5, but not exactly the same.

### Step 7

Solve the equation of stationarity $\boldsymbol\mu = \boldsymbol\mu \mathbf{P}$. Is the solution nearly equal to that in step 6?

```{r, warning=F}

e    <- eigen(P)
lvec <- MASS::ginv(e$vectors)

round(as.numeric(lvec[1,]/sum(lvec[1,])),3)

```

These values match those found in question 6.

### Step 8

Write your own conclusions based on this simulation experiment and give an explanation of the phenomenon you observe.

When simulating $n=1000$ steps of the Markov chain the initial state seems to influence the proportion of visits to each state. The reason we observe this phenomenon is that the chain has not "burned in" to the stationary distribution and run sufficiently long for the initial transitions to be obscured in the calculated proportions. 

We obtain the a good estimate of the stationary distribution when taking the transition matrix to a high power, however. This is different than simulating the chain from an intial state. Taking powers of the transition matrix computes transition probabilities from any state to any other state in the alloted number of steps, a much richer operation than observing one sample path in the simulation approach.
